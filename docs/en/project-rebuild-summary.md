# Minecraft Server Dashboard API V2 - Project Rebuild Summary

## Executive Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete project rebuild plan for the Minecraft Server Dashboard API V2. After extensive analysis of the current system's complexity issues, we have designed a complete ground-up rebuild that addresses all identified technical debt while maintaining full feature parity across 46 use cases.

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Problems
The current V1 system suffers from significant architectural complexity:
- **19 tightly coupled service files** creating circular dependencies
- **Complex startup sequence** with multiple failure points
- **Mixed soft/hard delete patterns** causing data consistency issues
- **JSON-heavy database design** with dual state management
- **Fragmented API design** across multiple router files
- **Complex testing requirements** due to tight coupling
- **Resource leaks** in WebSocket and background processing

### Technical Debt Impact
- Development velocity severely impacted by complexity
- Maintenance overhead consuming 60%+ of development time
- New feature integration increasingly difficult
- Testing becomes exponentially complex with each addition
- Performance degradation under load due to architectural issues

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Design Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear business domain boundaries
2. **Clean Architecture**: Dependency inversion with infrastructure outer layer
3. **CQRS + Event Sourcing**: Separate read/write models with event-driven architecture
4. **Microservices-Ready**: Modular design enabling future distribution
5. **Security-First**: Enterprise-grade security built into every layer

### Technology Stack Modernization

| Component | V1 Technology | V2 Technology | Improvement |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Framework | FastAPI 0.115 | FastAPI 0.115+ | Enhanced patterns, better async |
| Database | SQLite/Basic PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL 15+ with optimization | Better performance, scalability |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 | SQLAlchemy 2.0 with patterns | Clean repository pattern |
| Caching | Basic Redis | Redis 7+ with strategy | Comprehensive caching layers |
| Background Jobs | APScheduler | RQ + APScheduler | Proper job queue management |
| Real-time | Basic WebSockets | Optimized WebSockets + SSE | Better connection management |
| Monitoring | Basic logging | Structured logging + metrics | Full observability |
